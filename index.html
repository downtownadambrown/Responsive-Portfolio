            <p>After convincing my parents to buy me a QBasic programming book in third grade, I was off to the races.
                Initially, I was self-taught, until I was afforded the luxury of attending the best high school in
                Georgia in 10th grade to then graduate from. Upon my enrollment, they also began offering a Computer
                Science course for the first time ever. Dr Vesey was influential to me beyond what she even knows to
                this day, and she helped me learn Pascal, C++, and Java back in 1997.<br><br>

                Fast-forward to my time at the University of Georgia, where Dr. Basnayake inspired me to learn advanced
                systems and mainframe development, but the curriculum didn't match what I wanted to do in my free time
                -- build websites. I shifted gears to a hybridized Mathematics degree program where I was able to
                combine my interest in systems design with mathematical and even biological topics. Dr Zabcic offered a
                Mathematical Biology course which was arguably the most interesting class I ever took.<br><br>

                After school and some freelance web development work, by accident, I fell into recruiting and got to
                learn from amazing, successful professionals in and outside Atlanta such as Jared Kennedy, Mike
                Ventura, Joe Ventura, Josh Nazarian, Kelly Meadows, Joel Leege, Kevin Krull, Rebecca Nickeas, and Dave
                MacKeen. These 6 years of my life were a dream, honestly, as I was doing things I never thought I would
                be able to, all while helping change peoples lives in the process.<br><br>

                For me, my heart has always been in technology. It's no surprise that I find myself devoting all my
                free time to anything related to technology, computers, gaming, vehicle technology, programming, and
                things like that. I am going to continue where I left off and become a successful software engineer.
